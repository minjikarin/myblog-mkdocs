I have definitely needed to have a management tool. one of my friends shared with me a useful excel format that he has developed... but I got stuck updating the formats when implementing multiple wallets and currencies.\ud83d\udc40 that was where I started exploring online free crypto portfolio management tool. and I end up using CoinMarketCap.</p> <p>https://coinmarketcap.com/</p> <p>why I need a manual portfolio :</p> <p>Of course all automation by syncing with my each exchange/wallets will be super ideal. However, I can\u2019t use or don\u2019t need a automated sync tool because,</p> <p>my assets are everywhere as in multiple centralized exchange accounts, Metamask and a hard wallet. as my assets especially in exchange is not with an address, the sync won\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t want to waste trx fee to move my assets into one wallet which can be synced for a portfolio tool. there is no point for that (apart from a security concern from centralized exchange) as long as I just want to keep them for investment. even though I have all my assets in few wallets which can be synced, there will be no accurate info about \u2018profit/loss\u2019.</p> <p>Benefits that I have found useful on CoinMarketCap Portfolio.</p> <ol> <li> <p>it supports multiple fiat currencies so I can add transactions with my preferred currency. and I can quickly switch to others.</p> </li> <li> <p>each transaction can be added with \u2018fee\u2019. it is quite ashamed that fee can be added as only with a fiat currency. (related to a suggestion #4 below)</p> </li> <li> <p>Price per coin can be added with manual input regardless of the time and date of transactions. (I love this!) the exact price at the time of transaction was something that I had difficult to manage in excel\u2026(I struggled a lot with API \ud83e\udd2a) so convenient to input.</p> </li> <li> <p>basic but great visual chart and clear UI to understand profit/Loss per asset type.</p> </li> </ol> <p>as I was struggled a lot to have a same results from excel.. I sincerely appreciate the service and detail features (and it\u2019s free).</p> <p>Things to improve ( would be great :))</p> <p>but there are of course some features that I would love to have and suggest to implement \ud83d\ude0d. I would say still CoinMarketCap portfolio is not 100% for active DeFi user who do staking, swapping, depositing tokens into the contract.</p> <pre><code>Add an attribute \u2018wallet\u2019 or \u2018account\u2019. it would be great if we can differentiate the transactions per wallet/account so that we can clear see where the assets are.\nAdd \u2018transfer to other wallet\u2019 (internal transfer between wallet/account). currently \u2018transfer\u2019 action is only for \u2018transfer out\u2019 and \u2018transfer in\u2019. so I have used \u2018Transfer out\u2019 for ETH transactions fee that I have paid when staking and buying NFT. if suggestion 1) is implemented, this feature will be also mandatory..\nAdd \u2018Token swap\u2019 transaction. when I tried to input my transaction swapping ETH to DPI, I needed to input 2 separate transactions : 1)\u2018Transfer out\u2019 to remove amount of ETH and fee 2)\u2019Buy\u2019 DPI with the manual calculation of the price. it would be great to have the token swap transaction instead of putting 2.\nFee as crypto currency. as mentioned above, fee can be added only with fiat currently. there are many transactions with crypto currency fee, so would be great to have this improvement.\nImport/Export to excel feature. as long as there is a feature sync with excel file.. it would a PERFECT crypto portfolio management tool!\n</code></pre> <p>above are my personal opinions about CoinMarketCap portfolio, and I am sincerely appreciate to the team who provide this service! I will use it until I find a better one that I can easily input my transactions.</p>","tags":["blog","blockchain"]},{"location":"blog/kimp-python-telegram-en/","title":"Kimchi Premium Telegram bot by a python beginner","text":"<p>As a non-programmer who has work experiences as a project manager and is interested in IT development, I have learnt basic python from a Udemy course since pandemic is all over the world. and as many people aware, the kimchi premium was more than 10\u201315% in 2021 April-May, and I decided to create my own telegram bot to have a notification of kimchi premium rate as well as to practice my python with a real use case.</p> <p>t.me/kimp_tracker_bot What is kimchi premium by the way?</p> <p>Kimchi premium is basically a price gap between South Korea crypto exchanges and other countries. The price difference may be caused by many different reasons such as a strong capital control by Korea government or/and by a lack of high-return investment options for investors in South Korea. Personally as a Korean expat out of South Korea, i more believe that the reason is a strong capital and financial control by governments. it is difficult to take out my Korean won to out of Korea\u2026 too many regulation, too high transfer fees. What does this kimchi premium bot do?</p> <p>this kimchi premium telegram bot is returning the real time price differences between Upbit (Korean exchange) and Bitkub(Thailand exchange) \u2014 KRW vs THB. you can set up an alert to receive a notification when the kimchi premium rate is higher/lower than a specific % per crypto currency. in the future I am planning to add bithumb exchange for EUR.</p> <p>I have uploaded my code in my github repository. as an open source and I would like to receive feedback/advice on my code by posting this blog :) Let\u2019s look into the code!</p> <p>everything is based on \u2018functions\u2019 in python.

I am sure for professional programmer, it may take only 1\u20132 hours to complete (haha). bur for me it was a great learning and I am proud of myself to accomplish my first real use case bot for me to use.

Let\u2019s look into them</p> <p>This is my personal experiences and opinions !</p> <p>What is Alchemix?</p> <p>Alchemix is a self-repay loans protocol that you can deposit your DAI or ETH as a collateral and you borrow 50% of the collateral. interests that you get from deposit will reply your debt. What does self-repay loans means?</p> <p>Alchemix allows 50% borrowings from your deposit. so when you borrow 50% of 1000USD for example, you have 500 USD debt with 1000USD deposit. you do whatever you want with 500 USD. but you need to pay out this debt somehow. so here, Alchemix algorithm is that they help to deposit your 1000 USD, get interests from depositing, make these interests to repay your loan(500USD) with time. the amount of time is depends on your deposit, debt, APY for sure. but yes, this is the simple explanation of \u2018self-repay loans\u2019</p> <p>ok sounds great, then now we need some calculation of when can we get some profit with transactions fees.</p> <p>here is the tricky part. I have found that using Alchemix is not something you put deposit and get interests. you won\u2019t get anything unless you borrow. I have deposited some amount of DAI, and watch few days that how much I can get profits. yes there are interests that I am getting. but the additional amount is adding into the amount of borrow that I can borrow. not adding into the amount of deposit that I put already.</p> <p>so, what does it mean : I need to make debt and make this debt to be repaid with interests in specific period time. yes this is what exactly self-repay loans mean. but if we want to take out the deposit before my debt is fully repaid, we need to repay the debt or liquidate our collateral (DAI) to repay the debt. Yes it is returning interests, but only when you borrow alUSD.</p> <p>I am just thinking from a perspective of \u2018investor\u2019 who need capital gain. the alchemix model is a great model for guaranteed gains but you need to create yout debt to earn, and also repay debt to have actual gains. I\u2019m sharing this as a investor, i imagined just simple model as depositing + interests.hah! what does it mean? : lots of transactions :) How many transactions are required?</p> <p>my scenario is : you put deposit, 50% borrow, put this borrowing again into the deposit and let the interests repay my debt. and here, as it takes time to repay full debt, I put assumption that you take out deposit before the full repay.</p> <ul> <li>Approve DAI send</li> <li>Deposit DAI to Alchemix</li> <li>Borrow alUSD</li> <li>Approve alUSD</li> <li>Spend Swap alUSD to DAI</li> <li>Deposit DAI to Alchemix (2nd deposit)</li> <li>Repay debt alUSD or liquidate DAI</li> <li>Withdraw DAI</li> </ul> <p>Total 8 transactions required! this is quite a number of transactions, and with the fact that I will have a debt, I started having doubt.</p> <p>I will share the actual gas fee that I have paid once I complete the 8 transaction journey. as there are many transactions, we need to bear in mind that there must be a minimum amount of DAI to use in order to have profit.

A friend asked me how I use the new GPT model or if I'm subscribing to ChatGPT Plus to use the GPT-4 model. I'm not paying for ChatGPT Plus (it's too expensive!), instead, I'm using APIs directly. It's super easy to use without any development (coding). I hope even non-developers can learn how to use APIs to take advantage of this.

However, since many projects are open-source, you also need to be careful of API key leaks. If someone else gains access to your OpenAI API key, they can use all the API usage and your bill can skyrocket! </p> <p>To avoid any API key leak, I decided to run an open-source project on my local machine (my laptop). This way, you can safely use your API key without exposing it to the internet. </p> <p>The open-source project that I'm currently using is https://github.com/enricoros/big-agi. The development team is continuously developing new features, which I truly appreciate! (I'm not paid for this endorsement, it's purely personal support :D) </p> <p>You can also use their URL directly without running it locally, but I don't feel secure enough yet, so I avoid any issues by running it locally. Please note that if you find any other open-source project, you can follow the same process to run it locally. </p> <p>In my next article, I'll cover how to use this open-source project on your local machine using your API key safely. :) What open-source projects are you using?
