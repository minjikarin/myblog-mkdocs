# Hello! 

Hi! Iâ€™m **Minji Kim**, a developer advocate at Amadeus for Developers.

With over 7 years of experience working abroad, I have a passion for travel, cultural differences, and technology. 

I mainly help developers build travel applications with **Amadeus Travel APIs** more efficiently by providing technical materials. I am also fascinated by the **Open-Source world**, where people contribute their skills and knowledge to help each other, fostering a sense of trust and a shared vision. I also love understanding different cultures by **traveling**. I am from South Korea, working in France after a 6-year stint in Thailand. 

This website is for you to check my contents from everywhere. Enjoy! :)
