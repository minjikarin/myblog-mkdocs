It's been over half a year since I started my journey with Obsidian. It's been a fantastic experience, It has significantly boosted my daily productivity, bringing a new level of organisation to my life. The flexibility Obsidian offers with Markdown, along with its community plug-ins, are stand-out features that I believe everyone should know about.

In this article, I'm going to share how I've tailored my iOS shortcuts to take notes & track my to-do's in Obsidian, a system that has been working brilliantly for me for over 2 months now. I discovered this setup through the r/Obsidian subreddit, and it's been a game-changer.

## My Obsidian setup

First, In order to demonstrate what i have tried to achieve with iOS Shortcuts, This is how my Obisidan is currently set up: 

- I create **Weekly notes** with [periodic notes plugin](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) & [templater plugin](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/introduction.html)
- In weekly notes, my tasks (past due/due today/ due this week) is appeared from [obsidian-task plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) & [dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugins
- Obisidian is stored via iCloud for sync with my iPhone & Mac

My behaviour for productivity

- Whenever i think of a thing to do, i put it in my weekly note with due date
- Random thoughts to be taken also in weekly note
- A note for Grocery list to do grocery shopping every weekend for a week (simple to-do format)
- A content list note to remember Contents idea from random thoughts

## The Challenge I Faced 
Secondly, let's explore the problem at hand and what I sought to resolve. I was happy with the idea of a weekly note featuring my to-do list, but I encountered a hitch. 

Whenever a new to-do item or a random thought poped up, or when I needed to update my grocery list, I had to launch the Obsidian app on my iPhone. This process, which takes a while, required me to click on the weekly note and type `- [ ] ...`. This proved to be a cumbersome task for such small to-dos, and I started skipping note-taking altogether, leading me back to dis-organization. 

Thus, I found myself in search of a quicker way to access my Obsidian notes and jot down thoughts on the fly. That's when I discovered `Shortcuts`! 


## Apple Shortcuts 

[Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/shortcuts/apdf22b0444c/ios) is a visual scripting application developed by Apple, available across the Apple ecosystem (Mac, iPhone, etc.). I was astounded that I hadn't explored this feature before! It was the perfect blend of automation and self-scripting power, coupled with the flexibility of Obsidian!

## My Shortcuts 1. a To-do into weekly note

![to-do1](../images/to-do1.GIF)

You can easily input your to-do list by clicking shortcuts, add them **without opening Obisidian**. 

![to-do1](../images/to-do1.jpeg)

1. I ask for text with "What is your to-do?" 
2. I take 'tomorrow' variable in order to inject as data (I use [obsidian-task plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) and sort by due date)
3. the text including `-[]` and `#task` together with tomorrow's date as a due and current date is captured
4. Add the captured text into the path `YYYY`/`YYYY-[W]ww` as a new line (I use [periodic notes plugin](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) to set up my weekly note)

## My Shortcuts 2. Grocery idea into grocery note

Same logic here and simpler than to-do list. simple text injection into the static file. 

![grocery1](../images/grocery1.jpeg)

1. I ask for text with "What to buy?" 
2. The text including `-[]` is captured
3. Add the captured text into the file `Grocery.md` 


## Closing 

What do you think? It's super simple automation everyone can setup without a single line of code. Hope my small tips help you to increase your daily productivity too! Please feel free to share yours in comment below too :)
